# SFML_Tetris

Tetris clone using SFML based off and using assets from this [video](https://youtu.be/zH_omFPqMO4?si=CAL0uuf-0cqUdIwa).

Integrated basic UI using ImGui to control the speed of the pieces dropping, and also changed the colouring of tetris pieces
to be standard colours rather than completely random.
